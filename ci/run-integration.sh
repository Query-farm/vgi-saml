# Run this repo's sqllogictest suite (test/sql/*.test) against the vgi-saml
# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source.
#
# This is the runner the Docker image_test (.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml)
# drives to prove the built container image speaks the protocol over each
# transport. The repo's day-to-day E2E entry point is still `run_tests.sh` (which
# builds the release binary and runs the same suite over the stdio transport);
# this script adds the http leg + honors a pre-launched container URL.
#
# Parameterized by TRANSPORT (default: subprocess), exercising the SAME suite
# over each transport the vgi extension supports — the only thing that changes
# is what LOCATION (VGI_SAML_WORKER) the .test files ATTACH:
#
#   subprocess  VGI_SAML_WORKER = the stdio worker command (DuckDB spawns it).
#               In the image_test this is `docker run -i --rm <img> stdio`.
#   http        start `saml-worker --http` (auto port; advertises `PORT:<n>`
#               on stdout), VGI_SAML_WORKER = http://127.0.0.1:<port>.
#               If VGI_SAML_WORKER is ALREADY set to an http(s):// URL (e.g. a
#               pre-launched container in the docker image_test), it is used
#               as-is and no local worker is spawned.
#
# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST  path to the haybarn-unittest binary
# Optional:
#   WORKER_BIN        path to the compiled saml-worker binary (used to launch the
#                     http server, and as the stdio LOCATION). Defaults to the
#                     release build in this repo.
#   TRANSPORT         subprocess | http           (default: subprocess)
#   STAGE             scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)
#   TEST_PATTERN      runner glob/path under the staged tree to execute
#                     (default: test/sql/*). All files are always staged; this
#                     only narrows what RUNS — e.g. a single-file stdio smoke.
