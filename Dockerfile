# Single image that serves every network transport of the `saml` VGI worker:
#   docker run ... IMG            -> HTTP server on $PORT      (default; Fly.io / local)
#   docker run ... IMG tcp        -> raw Arrow-IPC over TCP on $PORT_TCP
#   docker run -i ... IMG stdio   -> stdio worker DuckDB spawns on-host
# See docker-entrypoint.sh.
#
# Like vgi-units this worker is STATELESS: it is verify-only — decode + exclusive
# C14N + XML-DSig verification + XSW / Golden-SAML detection over bytes the caller
# already holds. No key store, no trust store, no network egress, no per-attach
# state. So there is no /data volume, no state registry, and no
# `farm.query.vgi.volumes` mount-discovery label. The image is just the binary +
# a tiny entrypoint.
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ---- build stage -----------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned glibc (bookworm) so the binary links against the same libc the slim
# runtime ships. The worker is pure Rust (rsa, x509-parser, roxmltree, flate2,
# arrow, vgi) — no native xmlsec1 / OpenSSL — so no extra build deps are needed.
